# HuffmanCode
This code addresses Huffman coding, an algorithm used for data compression. data compression. Huffman encoding uses a specific method to choose the representation of each symbol, resulting in a prefix code that represents the most common characters using a prefix code. of each symbol, which results in a prefix code representing the most common characters using the shortest bit strings, and the shortest bit strings, and vice versa. Based on two samples with character frequencies from Spanish and English, a Hufmann tree is created for each. These will be used to obtain the encoding of each of the characters and with this encoding, firstly, to check that the first theorem is satisfied. that Shannon's first theorem is satisfied, secondly to encode a cognate word, and finally to decode a given word, finally decode a given word.
